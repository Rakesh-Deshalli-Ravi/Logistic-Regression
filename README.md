# Logistic-Regression
A from-scratch implementation of Logistic Regression in Python. This project demonstrates the core concepts of logistic regression, including gradient descent, sigmoid function, and cost optimization. It's an excellent resource for those learning about machine learning and binary classification algorithms.

# Logistic Regression Implementation from Scratch

This repository contains a Python implementation of Logistic Regression built from scratch. The project aims to provide a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts behind the logistic regression algorithm.

## Features
